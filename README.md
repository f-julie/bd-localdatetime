# Overview Of the Project

## Introduction:

In the lesson, students will construct a simple application using their knowledge of Java.  This application will feature the LocalDateTime class and specifically one of its methods ZonedDateTime.  

Students will be given this scenario:

You are a software developer for a small global team in your town. Other Members are located in Dublin , New York City, San Francisco, Chicago.  You have been tasked with developing a way to make sure that members do not call or set up meetings outside of business hours. Meetings last an hour at the maximum time limit.  Use this information in development.  

Project Objectives:
Give the current time in their own timezone as well as the times in four other locations.  This information will be printed to the command line.  


# Key Java Topics That Will Be Covered

If you don't have an API, then no worries! ReadMe is great for any sort of documentation. But if you have an API, we make it really easy to get started.

 *  Objects
 *  Classes
 *  Methods
 *  Booleans
 *  Output to the console


# Essential Questions

 * What is LocalDateTime?
 * How can I use LocalDateTime in my applications?
 * Where can I find the methods associated with this class?
 * How can I adjust for  time zone differences?

# Learning Objectives


 * The basics of LocalDateTime
 * Create a simple application using LocalDateTime
 * Use ZonedDateTime method to obtain  the time correct date and time in other timezones
 * Improve your knowledge of Java
